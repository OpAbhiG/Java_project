In this program, we first generate a random number between 1 and 100 using the nextInt() method from the Random class. Then, we create a Scanner object to read the user's input from the console.

The program enters a loop where the user is prompted to enter their guess. After each guess, we check if it is lower, higher, or equal to the randomly generated number. If it's lower, we provide a hint ("Too low! Try again.") and if it's higher, we provide another hint ("Too high! Try again."). If the guess is equal to the number, we display a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts made.

The loop continues until the user guesses the correct number. Once the loop is exited, we close the Scanner object.

You can compile and run this program in any Java development environment or by using the command line. Enjoy playing the game!
