Using Tkinter Library in Python with features Reset/Stop and Pause/Resume

The project involves developing a graphical user interface (GUI) application using the Tkinter library in Python. The application has two primary features, which are Reset/Stop and Pause/Resume. The Reset/Stop feature allows users to stop the application's execution completely or reset the application to its initial state. The Pause/Resume feature enables users to pause the application's execution temporarily and then resume it from where it left off.
